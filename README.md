# ReconViaGen
This repo demonstrates an unofficial pytorch implementation of [ReconViaGen: Towards Accurate Multi-view 3D Object Reconstruction via Generation](https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen/). Thanks for the great work of [Jiahao](https://github.com/Jiahao620)!

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/estheryang11/ReconViaGen.git
cd ReconViaGen
```

Create a conda environment (optional):
```bash
conda create -n reconviagen python=3.10
conda activate reconviagen
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
# pytorch (select correct CUDA version)
pip install torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/{your-cuda-version}
pip install spconv-cu{your-cuda-version}==2.3.6 xformers==0.0.27.post2
# other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Adaptation for H20 (CUDA 12.4)
For users running on NVIDIA H20 GPUs with CUDA 12.4, we provide a specific requirements file `requirements_cu124.txt`. This file includes all necessary dependencies, including PyTorch, xformers, and other libraries. You do **not** need to install PyTorch separately as described in the general installation steps.

One-step installation for H20:
```bash
# Install all dependencies (including PyTorch) for CUDA 12.4
pip install -r requirements_cu124.txt
```

## Local Demo 🤗
Run by:
```bash
python app_refine.py
```
To improve the accuracy of camera registration, we adjust and optimize the camera pose estimation strategy in ReconViaGen slightly.
